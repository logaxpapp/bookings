    q: 'What if I only need an account for a few months out of the year?',
    a: "No worries! Many professionals utilize LogaXP for specific seasonal periods, making it a particularly popular choice for businesses with fluctuating seasonal demands. However, after completing your LogaXP usage for the required period, you have the option to place your account in hibernation mode. During hibernation, you can specify a reactivation date. When that date arrives, you will receive step-by-step reactivation instructions to assist you in restoring your account. Your data remains securely stored, eliminating the need to reconfigure everything. Rest assured; you won't incur charges during the inactive months.",

    id: 2,
    q: 'What are the different security levels that I can provide for my staff?',
    a: `
There are four different staff security levels in LogaXP and they determine different access rights within the app. The four security levels are:

  1. Account Owner: By default, this is the individual who initially registered the account. The Account Owner enjoys complete access to all account information and can edit any data. This includes appointments, clients of all staff, and configuration settings for online booking. Additionally, the Account Owner can access billing information.

  2. Administrators: Staff members designated as administrators share the same access rights as the Account Owner, with the exception that they cannot modify or view billing details or overall Account Settings. Administrators can view appointments for all staff, clients across the entire business, and update settings, including creating staff profiles and modifying security statuses for other staff members.

  3. Location Super Users: Staff members designated as location super users can view and make changes to all appointments and client data within the assigned location(s). However, they lack the ability to modify settings or access appointments and clients at locations where they have not been granted access. They can access their own staff profiles to update availability and class schedules.

  4. Users: Staff members designated as users have limited access, allowing them to view only the appointments made with them and clients who have booked with them. They can access their own staff profiles but cannot view other account settings.

  Please note that only the Account Owner and administrators can modify security levels for other staff members. Location Super Users and Users do not possess this privilege.
  For business-level subscriptions, the option exists to create custom security roles to better align with specific needs if the default roles do not provide an exact match.`,
